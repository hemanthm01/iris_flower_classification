# iris flower classification

Iris Flower classification is built using Support Vector Machine using Linear Kernel

Model is deployed using flask and an interactive website also designed to give the input values or dimmentions of an iris flower. 
We trained the model in such a way that if we provide Sepal width, Sepal Length, Petal Width and Petal Length it will predict the type of iris flower.

Below is the difference between them and classification differences.

We have designed an interactive design to give the Sepal width, Sepal Length, Petal Width and Petal Length values and input as shown below.

Based on the input data model will predicts and gives the output.

Classification can be made by difference in the lenghths and below is the difference in dimmentions of the iris flower

Through the systematic procedure, we successfully built the model and deployed to realtime using Flask and designed a website using html.
